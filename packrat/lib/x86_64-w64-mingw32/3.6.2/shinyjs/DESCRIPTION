Authors@R: person("Dean", "Attali", email = "daattali@gmail.com", role

Description: Perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny apps
    that will greatly improve your apps without having to know any
    JavaScript. Examples include: hiding an element, disabling an
    input, resetting an input back to its original value, delaying code
    execution by a few seconds, and many more useful functions for both
    the end user and the developer. 'shinyjs' can also be used to
    easily call your own custom JavaScript functions from R.
