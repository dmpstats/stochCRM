Title: Multi-State Markov and Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time
Author: Christopher Jackson <chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Christopher Jackson <chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>
Description: Functions for fitting continuous-time Markov and hidden
    Markov multi-state models to longitudinal data.  Designed for
    processes observed at arbitrary times in continuous time (panel
    data) but some other observation schemes are supported. Both Markov
    transition rates and the hidden Markov output process can be
    modelled in terms of covariates, which may be constant or
    piecewise-constant in time.
