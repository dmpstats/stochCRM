* Added a new comments parameter to rhandsontable to allow bulk comment specification.

* Added a new shiny _comment callback to track changes to table comments. See the new rhandsontable_comment example for more details.

-------------------------

* Added a project page at http://jrowen.github.io/rhandsontable

* Upgraded to handsontable 0.16.1

* Improved mapping between R classes and handsontable column types.  Numeric columns
  in R are now mapped to numeric columns in the table, and factors are now
  mapped as dropdown columns (#30).

* Numeric columns are now formatted as '0' for integers and '0.00' for all other
  numeric columns.  See http://http://numeraljs.com/ for more details on
  formatting options.

* Sparkline charts (http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/) can now be added to the
  table.  See the project page for examples, and thanks to the sparkline package and
  Ramnath Vaidyanathan for inspiration.  The sparkline chart width will be
  set to fit within the specified column width.  The feature is still evolving, so
  please pass along feedback.

* Display NA values as blank cells in the table.  This requires changing colums with NA
  values to character when displaying in handsontable and may require special handling
  for Date and factor columns.  See the examples on the project page for more details.
  Thanks to Melanie Bacou for the suggestion.

* Added stretchH parameter to hot_table.

* Fixed a bug where the table was not updated when resized.

* Fixed a bug with row indices when sorting rows (#34)
