Description: Functions introduced or changed since R v3.0.0 are
    re-implemented in this package. The backports are conditionally
    exported in order to let R resolve the function name to either the
    implemented backport, or the respective base version, if available.
    Package developers can make use of new functions or arguments by
    selectively importing specific backports to support older
    installations.
