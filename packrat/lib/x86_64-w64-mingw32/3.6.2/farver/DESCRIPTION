Description: The encoding of colour can be handled in many different
    ways, using different colour spaces. As different colour spaces
    have different uses, efficient conversion between these
    representations are important. The 'farver' package provides a set
    of functions that gives access to very fast colour space conversion
    and comparisons implemented in C++, and offers speed improvements
    over the 'convertColor' function in the 'grDevices' package.
