(i) Parameters Distributional Issues:
  - % of downtime parameterized as Normal when it should always be >= 0
  - Proportion of Nocturnal Activity parameterized as Normal
  - Proportion at Collision risk height parameterized as Normal
  - Probability of basic and extended avoidance parameterized as Normal 
  

(ii) current restrictions
  - only ONE turbine model allowed
  - Only listed species allowed


(iii) hidden restrictions
  - according the Masden report, by default rotation speed and blade pitch specified in relation to windspeed, which requires
  distributional hyper-parameters for those two variables to be left blank
