TO DO's - Shiny App

(i) Bugs
  - something's wrong with the annual collisions density plot - it looks like the distributions are being 
  cropped on the x-axis (compare with the Masden's plots)
  - Check if there are conflicts between simultaneous users in terms of files saved to disk on shinyapps.io
  

(ii) Coding:
  - Tidy-up code via sourcing aux files, functions and Shiny's modulatization tool
  
  
(iii) Performance and behaviour
  - final validation step when simulation is triggered - manage how NA's in input pars are dealt with (flaggin them to the user)
  - Profile and improve performance
  - improve progress bar
  
  
(iv) UI side
  - Add logos of DMP, HiDef & MarineScotland(?)
  - add description of what Options 1, 2 & 3 entail
  - Add progress bar for rendering output plots


(v) Aesthetics 
  - color scheme, theme, style
  - better-looking buttons, plots, icons
  - Add version control (i.e. version number, releases log, etc) in sidebar
  
  
(vi) Additional features
  - Walkthrough help system via intraJS
  - TextBox to describe how parameters were devised
  







LOG OF CHANGES
  (i) Removed stochasticity from Turbine Model, Rotos Radius, Air Gap, Max Blade width
  
  (ii) Masden file: "sampleturbineparams.r" - Added option to sample Turbine's Rotation speed and blade pitch from self-contained probability 
  distributions - Used Truncated Normal bounded at 0
  
  (iii) Masden file: "sampleturbineparams.r" - Fixed bug with the sampling of turbine monthly operations - class of monthly operation (fixed) needs to be numeric, otherwise the vector of differences between monthly operation and downtime (stochastic) is fixed at the first value sampled
  from downtime.
  
  (iv) Masden Files: "sampleturbineparams.r" & "BandModel_function.r" - simulated windSpeed values added to stored turbined params for summary outputs
  
  (v) Include sampled parameter values in output files to be downloaded by user
  
  (vi) Possibility to add flight heights distributions (FHD) and bootstraps of FHD for species not listed or to 
  update current FHD data
  
  (vii) Added customized functions for beta and truncated normal distributions - Masden file changed: "helpers_samplingh_functions.r"
  
  (viii) bird biometric params "Body Length", "Wing Span" and "Flight Speed" are now being resampled as truncated normals bounded at 0 - 
   Masden file changed: "helpers_sampling_functions.r"
  
  (ix) bird biometric params "Nocturnal Activity", "Basic Avoidance", "Extended Avoidance" & "Proportion at CRH" are now being
  resampled as beta distributions - Masden file changed: "helpers_sampling_functions.r"
  
  (x) Add tables with sampled parameters values to Outputs zip file 
  
  (xi) Input values validation/sense-check (on-the-fly)
  
  (xii) added options for monthly bird densities: (a) truncated normal lower bounded at 0; (b) provide reference points (min, max and percentiles) & (c) random smples
  
  (xiii)
  
  

  
  








Overview of Model Parameters

  - 3 main categories of parameters:
  
    (i) Species specific parameters and data:
     a) Biometric, behaviour and flight speed parameters - 8 variables, 7 of which defined by 2 parameters (e.g. means and SD)
     b) Daytime in-flight monthly densities (birds/km2) - 12 variables, each defined by 2 parameters
     c) Flight height distributions (required for options 2 and 3) - a vector of values
     

    (ii) Wind farm & turbine parameters
      a) Windfarm parameters: 5 variables?
      b) Turbine parameters:
        -> Turbine features - 6 variables, 5 of which defined by 2 parms (2 with maybe depending on wind speed parameters and a matrix)
        -> Monthly operation - 24 variables (2 per month), 12 of which defined by 2 parameters
    
    (iii) simulation specifications
